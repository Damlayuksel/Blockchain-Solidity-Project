# FeeCollector Smart Contract DApp

**FeeCollector Smart Contract** is a decentralized application (DApp) built on the Ethereum blockchain. This project consists of a smart contract designed to collect fees and a frontend interface that allows users to interact with the contract. The contract is deployed using Remix IDE, and the frontend is built using JavaScript.

## Features

- **Blockchain-Based**: The FeeCollector Smart Contract operates directly on the Ethereum blockchain.
- **Smart Contract**: Collects fees based on predefined conditions, facilitating secure and automated transactions.
- **Open Source**: The source code for both the smart contract and frontend is open, allowing for review and contributions.
- **Decentralization**: Ensures transparency and security, with no central authority controlling the contract or data.
- **Token Integration**: The smart contract may interact with tokens or cryptocurrency to facilitate fee collection.

You can follow these steps to successfully interact with the FeeCollector Smart Contract.

## Getting Started

Follow the instructions below to deploy the smart contract and run the frontend locally.

### Requirements

- **Node.js**: Required for backend operations.
- **Remix IDE**: Used to deploy the Solidity smart contract on the Ethereum blockchain.
- **MetaMask**: A wallet extension for interacting with the Ethereum blockchain.
- **http-server**: A simple tool for serving the frontend locally.

### Steps to Run the FeeCollector Smart Contract DApp

1. **Deploy Smart Contract on Remix**
   - Open Remix IDE [here](https://remix.ethereum.org) and deploy the Solidity smart contract.
   - After the contract is successfully deployed, obtain the contract address from Remix.

2. **Update the Contract Address in JavaScript**
   - Open your frontend JavaScript file and replace the contract address with the one you received from Remix after deployment.

3. **Connect Wallet with MetaMask**
   - Install MetaMask in your browser and open it.
   - Connect MetaMask to the Ethereum network, and use WalletConnect to link your wallet with the DApp.

4. **Run the Frontend Locally**
   - Open your project folder in Visual Studio Code (VSCode).
   - In the terminal, run the command `http-server` to start the local server on `localhost`.

5. **Interact with the DApp**
   - Open your browser and navigate to `localhost` to access the frontend interface.
   - You can now interact with the FeeCollector Smart Contract and perform various operations directly on the Ethereum blockchain.
